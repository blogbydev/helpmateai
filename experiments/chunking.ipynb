If the Member is not Actively at Work on the date insurance would otherwise be effective, such insurance will not be in force until the day of return to Active Work. However, this Actively at Work requirement will be waived for Members who: (1) are absent from Active Work because of a regularly scheduled day off, holiday, or vacation day; and (2) were Actively at Work on their last scheduled work day before the date of their absence; and (3) were capable of Active Work on the day before the scheduled effective date of their insurance or change in their insurance, whichever is applicable. This Actively at Work requirement may also be waived as described below. When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy, the Active Work requirement may be waived for those Members who: (1) are eligible and enrolled under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue; and (2) were covered under the Prior Policy on the date of its termination. In no event will the Active Work requirement be waived for those Members who, on the date of termination of the Prior Policy, either: (1) had the option, under the terms of the Prior Policy, to convert their coverage under the Prior Policy to an individual policy; or (2) were eligible under the terms of the Prior Policy, to have their premiums waived due to ADL Disability or Total Disability. NOTE: When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy and the Active Work requirement is waived, any benefits payable will be the lesser of the Scheduled Benefit of this Group Policy or the amount that would have been paid by the Prior Policy had it remained in force. b. Effective Date for Initial Insurance When Proof of Good Health is Required Insurance for which Proof of Good Health is required (see e. below) will be in force on the later of: (1) the date insurance would have been effective if Proof of Good Health had not been required; or (2) the date Proof of Good Health is approved by The Principal. c. Effective Date for Initial Noncontributory Insurance When Proof of Good Health is not Required Unless Proof of Good Health is required (see b. above and e. below), insurance for which the Member contributes no part of premium will be in force on the date the Member is eligible. d. Effective Date for Initial Contributory Insurance When Proof of Good Health is not Required If a Member is to contribute a part of premium, insurance must be requested in a form provided by The Principal. Unless Proof of Good Health is required (see b. above and e. below), the requested insurance will be in force on: (1) the date the Member is eligible, if the request is made on or before that date; or (2) the date of the Member's request, if the request is made within 31 days after the date the Member is eligible. If the request is made more than 31 days after the date the Member is eligible, Proof of Good Health will be required before insurance can be in force (see b. above and e. below). e. Proof of Good Health Requirements The type and form of required Proof of Good Health will be determined by The Principal. A Member must submit Proof of Good Health: (1) If insurance for which a Member contributes a part of premium is requested more than 31 days after the date the Member is eligible including any insurance the Member refuses and later requests. (2) If insurance is requested under this Group Policy by a Member that was eligible under the Prior Policy, but elected to waive coverage under the Prior Policy. (3) If a Member has failed to provide required Proof of Good Health or has been refused insurance under this Group Policy at any prior time.

        "content": "A Member may be eligible to continue his or her Member Life and Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance coverage during the Member's ADL Disability or Total Disability. a. Coverage Qualification To be qualified for Coverage During Disability, a Member must: (1) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled while insured for Member Life Insurance; and (2) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled prior to the attainment of age 60; and (3) remain ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled continuously; and (4) be under the regular care and attendance of a Physician; and (5) send proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability to The Principal when required; and (6) submit to Medical Examinations or Evaluations when required; and (7) return to The Principal, without claim, any individual policy issued under his or her Individual Purchase Rights as described in PART III, Section F, Article 1. Upon return of such policy, The Principal will refund premiums paid, less dividends and less any outstanding policy loan balance. b. Proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability Written proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability must be sent to The Principal within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability begins. Further proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability has not ended must be sent when The Principal requires. After ADL Disability or Total Disability has continued for two years from the date the first proof is received, The Principal may not ask for further proof more than once each year. If the Member dies while ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled, final proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability continued to the date of death must be sent to The Principal. If death occurs within one year of the start of ADL Disability or Total Disability, but before The Principal has received first proof, then final proof must be sent within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability began. c. Medical Examinations and Evaluations The Principal may require that a ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled Member be examined by a Physician or undergo an evaluation, at reasonable intervals, during the course of a claim. After ADL Disability or Total Disability has continued two years from the date first proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability is received, examinations or evaluations may not be required more than once each year. The Principal will pay for these examinations and evaluations and will choose the Physician or evaluator to perform them. Failure to attend a medical examination or cooperate with the Physician may be cause for denial of the Member's benefits. Failure to attend an evaluation or to cooperate with the evaluator may also be cause for denial of the Member's benefits. If the Member fails to attend an examination or an evaluation, any charges incurred for not attending an appointment as scheduled may be his or her responsibility. d. Effective Dates and Premium Waiver Coverage During Disability will be effective for a qualified Member on the earliest of: (1) the date nine months after the date the Member becomes Totally Disabled; or (2) the date one month after the date the Member becomes ADL Disabled; or (3) the date the Member dies. Premium will not be charged for Member Life and Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance while the Member's Coverage During Disability is in force. e. Benefits Payable If death occurs while Coverage During Disability is in force, The Principal will pay the Member's beneficiary the Member Life Insurance benefit amount that would have been paid had the Member remained insured under the Schedule of Insurance in force on the date Total Disability began. Such benefit shall be subject to any reduction provided under the Schedule of Insurance. However, NO BENEFIT WILL BE PAID if Written proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability is not sent to The Principal within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability began. Failure to give Written proof within the time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if Written proof is given as soon as reasonably possible. Further, if a death benefit is paid under this section of the Group Policy, it will be in place of all other Member Life Insurance benefits provided under this Group Policy. f. Termination (Premium Waiver) Coverage During Disability will cease on the earliest of: (1) the date the Member's Total Disability ends; or (2) the date the Member fails to send The Principal any required proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability; or (3) the date the Member ceases to be under the regular care and attendance of a Physician; or (4) the date the Member fails to submit to a required Medical Examination or Evaluation; or (5) the date the Member attains age 70. g. Limitations No benefits will be paid for any disability that: (1) results from willful self-injury or self-destruction, while sane or insane; or (2) results from war or act of war; or (3) results from voluntary participation in an assault, felony, criminal activity, insurrection, or riot.

This period will end on the earlier of the Member's death or the date two years after the date of the Accelerated Benefit. During a premium waiver period: (1) there will be no Member Life and Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance premium charge for the Member; and (2) Member Life Insurance will not be terminated if the Member ceases Active Work because of his or her Terminal Illness.
